This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

1. Install nodejs. I'm currently using v8.9.4 but should work with any v8 and above
2. Checkout the code into a directory
3. In the root of the directory run:

```
npm install
```
4. Then run:

```
npm start
```
5. App should open automatically, but if not it's on http://localhost:3333
